# Bring Your Own Data Case Study

For the case study, you must build a web application using ![streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) that will allow users to upload a dataset and interactively build a model. A minimum viable product (MVP) will allow users to do the following:

- Upload a CSV file
- Train a model
- Evaluate the model

Any other enhancements/customizations are strongly encouraged! This is your opportunity to show your creative side while also demonstrating your technical ability so have fun with it and make it your own. You will present your solution to a panel, assume you will have roughly 15 minutes to demo and another 15 for questions. Please put your code in a public repository so that we can view/run your code.

---------------
## Instructions

1. Create a public repository (preferably on GitHub)
2. Build your streamlit application
3. Create a `requirements.txt` file so that we can clone your repository and install the necessary packages to run your code.
4. Push everything to your public repository and send us the link

Please reach out if you have any questions!
